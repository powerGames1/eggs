# Flamecord server
FlameCord is a fork of Travertine that fixes Netty Exploits, keeps your console clean from unnecessary messages and orders your BungeeCord modules in a simpler way.

## Server Ports
The minecraft server requires a single port for access (default 25565) but plugins may require extra ports to enabled for the server.


| Port  | default |
|-------|---------|
| Game  | 25565   |
